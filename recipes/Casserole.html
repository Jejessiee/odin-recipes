        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Cornbread stuffing is the secret ingredient in this cheesy baked Mexican ground beef casserole, also featuring diced tomatoes with jalapeno, chili powder, cumin, hot sauce, canned sweet corn, and Cheddar. I created this Mexican ground beef casserole when I wanted something different.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
            <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups water</li>
            <li>¼ cup salted butter</li>
            <li>1 (6 ounce) package cornbread stuffing mix (such as Stove Top)</li>
            <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes with jalapeno</li>
            <li>1 (10 ounce) can diced tomatoes with green chile peppers</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chili powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon hot pepper sauce (such as Tabasco), or more to taste</li>
            <li>1 (8.75 ounce) can sweet corn, drained</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef and onion in the hot skillet until beef is browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease.</li>
            <li>While the beef is cooking, make stuffing. Bring water and butter to a boil in a medium saucepan. Stir in stuffing mix; cover. Remove from heat. Let stand for 5 minutes. Fluff with a fork.</li>
            <li>Stir both cans of diced tomatoes, chili powder, cumin, and hot sauce into the beef mixture. Simmer for 2 minutes. Add corn and Cheddar cheese. Simmer until cheese is melted completely, about 1 minute. Transfer mixture to a casserole dish. Spread cornbread stuffing evenly over the top.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until browned, 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
