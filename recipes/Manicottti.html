       <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>“Manicotti” (which means, literally, “little sleeves”) can refer to both a pasta shape and an Italian dish. Manicotti shells are large, tubular, and intended to be stuffed. Traditionally, manicotti is stuffed with a cheese mixture and baked in a tomato sauce.  </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>5 ½ ounces manicotti pasta</li>
            <li>1 pint part-skim ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>8 ounces shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried parsley</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook manicotti in boiling water until al dente, about 10 to 12 minutes; drain and rinse with cold water.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Mix ricotta, mozzarella, 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, eggs, parsley, salt, and pepper in a large bowl until well combined.</li>
            <li>Pour 1/2 cup spaghetti sauce into an 11x17-inch baking dish. Stuff each manicotti shell with 3 tablespoons cheese mixture, and arrange over sauce. Pour remaining sauce over the top of the shells and sprinkle with remaining Parmesan cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly, about 45 minutes.</li>
